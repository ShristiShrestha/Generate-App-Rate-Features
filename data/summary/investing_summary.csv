i put in a large sum and purchased some crypto 
by the next day the gemini staff notified me that my bank would not be compatible for what is needed to trade on gemini 
they said i needed an ach transferable account 
i was refunded the full amount that i deposited and all my currencies were set to 0.00
my account i thought was set to go back to a zero balance and all the trades were not awarded 
by now i'm getting annoyed 
i want to close the account but figured i could be at ease knowing all the money i put in was given back and i'm neutral 
so at the beginning of the next month about a week later my bank account gets slapped with another large bill pay putting me upside down for the month

so after paying my rent and being stuck with a fee that i have nothing to show for no value of currency or service provided
i'm accruing numerous fees from my bank for overdraft nsf charges and i'm seeing red
gemini is responsible for this 
i emailed four or five times 
no customer service has contacted me back or resolved any of the matter
i feel taken advantage of 
knowing that this fraudulent or mistake of a charge to my account will not be resolved 
in any timely manner
and honestly i want to be compensated for the hit i took to my bank account after the account was clearly inactive and in the clear
all of a sudden cryptocurrency showed up in my portfolio as if the original minimal spending on smaller crypto's were awarded

26485,0.513328162,"nothing works on apple since march 2020 - not even basic login!!! login doesn't work since march 2020 on fidelity app on apple ipad pro, and now the login does not work on the google chrome and siri on apple ipad pro ios 15... numerical password with 10 numerals and then letters and special characters can't be typed as fidelity app keeps switching apple native keyboard from numbers to letters while password is typed. on fidelity chrome website version, this issue is occuring since this monday, 9-27-21. apple ios was updated 2 weeks ago to latest ios 15 and i was at least able to log in on chrome and siri until 9-27-21, while having issues with keyboard randomly switching on the app. now all 3 applications: the apple store app, google chrome based application and siri application are broken for typing numerical alpha password. on the exact same device, keyboard is not switching on other password typing entry points such as typing logins and passwords for wi-fi and numerous sites like morning star, bloomberg, etc. when i complained about not being able to place a fractional trade about 1 year ago via feedback as fidelity software code locked in the phone dialer keyboard on the field where you would type the number of shares and would not give an option to type the decimal point, that issue surprisingly was addressed quickly... within just less than a week. an issue with broken watch lists on apple ipad fidelity app was finally seemingly resolved after me complaining weekly via app feedback for the past 52 weeks every other day or so... and monthly via their representatives who are incredibly helpful when it comes to placing the trades etc, but they seem to be powerless as far as escalation of the technology issues and bugs... and advocating on behalf of their customer they are helping to trade as the application does not work... but login issues keyboard switching bug is still not addressed and ignored despite me giving numerous examples of specific behavior of keyboard switching to electronic channel support and reps, the issue is now only worse as of monday, 9-27-21 i can't login on google chrome and siri without typing 1 number, watching the keyboard being switched by fidelity software code bug to letters only keyboard (naturally only apple ipad native keyboard, no 3rd party which worked for years just fine) if not for fidelity knowledgeable traders and my spare android phone where things work as expected for years, i would definitely have left fidelity. electronic channel support didn't even not care either of these or major login issues on the app since march 2020 (it now allows me to type 3-4 numerical characters in the password field, but not a long string without keyboard being switched by fidelity software code)... it doesn't appear there is any testing of the application for basic features and screens to work on even old iphone or ipad on apple. how about this idea: hiring s single apple native developer (out of college freshman in usa or even a college intern in usa) who actually would fix all these flaws such as tiny unadjustable font for for people to actual read great content and who would be more than happy to test apple ipad and iphone app on any second hand devices one can buy for $200- 300 on amazon prime. instead of all electronic channel support, fidelity should invest in a single apple native developer and a good qat team who would follow traders business scripts and test manually clicking on things produce an expected predictable and correct outcome in the testing scripts developed with traders business and common sense. if i were working at fidelity qat i would probably start with testing how login works on apple ipad and iphone when password is 5 numberic digits and then 3-4 letters and special characters. make that test a good 15 min exercise to grasp that not even basics work on apple ipad and iphone and see how customers experience this app... that would be my suggestion... today, there was only a second electronic support person who had apple ipad device to test this issue and trying to give me workaround suggestions, yet, since it's not a native ios apple developer, it's really impossible to hope this issue would be even entered into their jira for issues tracking purposes... disappointingly, the feedback i have submitted via the app and via the website feedback is ignored as always for the past few years since march 2020 when password typing keyboard switching bug was first hard coded into fidelity seemingly new application...","an issue with broken watch lists on apple ipad fidelity app was finally seemingly resolved after me complaining weekly via app feedback for the past 52 weeks every other day or so...
