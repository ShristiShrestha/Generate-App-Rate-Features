27783,1.2058226090715687,i am afairlynew lyftriderand iheardheard that  t ub er is stiff competition to lyft and i find that to be true you ber seems to be much better in timing but the lyft drivers are excellent and very patient the last couple of days in a row because of problems at work i have been more than five minutes late to the meeting point from work to catch my lyft ride and i was able to contact them through the app and the drivers patiently waited and did not charge me extra for the pick up so i tried to pay them back by giving a better personal tip and they were very kind especially because of some mild disability here however one problem was that i had to catch another ride to work this morning through lyft and the driver never showed up i was already running 10 minutes late and then the lyft app finally popped up and even though the driver was already supposed to be there 15 minutes earlier it finally popped up telling me that another driver was still 25 minutes away and i would have totally missed my transportation to work so i canceled the lyft ride and called a local taxi and fortunately it only cost me a couple of dollars more plus tip for the local taxi but all in all lyft still has the best price is per ride and very patient drivers who are excellent and helpful with clean cars i am going to learn though not to schedule my morning trips to work with lyft because another strange thing they do is switch drivers on you in the middle of a trip while you're waiting on your first assigned driver it gives you one name and then somewhere later while you're waiting on that driver it changes names and gives you another car so drivers can cut you loose while you're waiting on them and choose somebody else not cool and this is happened to me in the morning so i may just stay away from lyft when i need a ride right before 8 am but otherwise i could not trade the grease on a brand new job for how good these afternoon lyft drivers have been to wait on me with great cars and great service and being flexible on what sort of tip that i give them so i try to tip them well as best i can great service and the best prices but the switching drivers is kind of weird and then totally canceling out on me when i'm waiting on them in the morning to get to work can become a crisis real quick because i am being paid a lot of money to go to work and cannot drive myself all i know i love lyft but they've got to get it together in the app for communications and messaging and not switching your driver while you're waiting on them thanks and hope you guys have safe travels out there i like this company,i am afairlynew lyftriderand iheardheard that  t ub er is stiff competition to lyft and i find that to be true you ber seems to be much better
