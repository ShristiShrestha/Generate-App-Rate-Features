Review: """"""
i was hesitant to book an uber bc of all the horror stories i heard about ubers stealing credit card info, drivers kidnapping, robbing, and even raping customers but my husband and i needed an uber bc we were going out in nashville the drop off went well nice driver clean car decent price but when it was time to pick us back up the app gave us a different driver we were out waiting on our ride freezing my phone ended up dying the driver never showed we walked a few blocks and found a way to charge my phone as soon as it came on it said the uber cancel the ride and still charged me i blamed it on my phone dying and just booked another ride it charged $50 more than the last uber but i was desperate freezing and i just wanted a ride so i booked it we still waited almost an hour finally the driver came he was great but i had to ask why is this ride so much more he said when it's a high demand for drivers the prices goes up ridiculous i tried calling uber to say we were at the pickup location and the driver canceled the ride we couldn't get anyone on the phone for customer service and the app is automated responses can't say i want use an uber again bc i travel a lot but i do hope you guys do better with a rider being able to call from a different phone if their phone dies also the price changes aren't fair

when they impose to leave the app page open

two credit cards as payment method after four rides 
less than 24 hour lyft sent me a notification the credit card set as default declined accepting the fee
lyft automatically breach second credit card which was my personal bank account charged 32.99 stating withdrawal for a lyft rude in san francisco which is where their hq
no way to have any decent lyft customer service reach out 
they instead act like a zelle emailed me more than 3 times to update my payment where i already deleted my credit card information because of their mess
now am without access to my bank account as i had to cancel the credit cards i had on file with lyft because of the unauthorized charges
they have yet contacted me in that regard
lyft snap their fingers and i should say how high

i never trust them 

i just had to use them this week due to an emergency i had to run to the er and other trips affecting me

end of review 
never trust this company 
they enjoy being a mess","
