Review: """"""
i was hesitant to book an uber bc of all the horror stories i heard about ubers stealing credit card info, drivers kidnapping, robbing, and even raping customers but my husband and i needed an uber bc we were going out in nashville the drop off went well nice driver clean car decent price but when it was time to pick us back up the app gave us a different driver we were out waiting on our ride freezing my phone ended up dying the driver never showed we walked a few blocks and found a way to charge my phone as soon as it came on it said the uber cancel the ride and still charged me i blamed it on my phone dying and just booked another ride it charged $50 more than the last uber but i was desperate freezing and i just wanted a ride so i booked it we still waited almost an hour finally the driver came he was great but i had to ask why is this ride so much more he said when it's a high demand for drivers the prices goes up ridiculous i tried calling uber to say we were at the pickup location and the driver canceled the ride we couldn't get anyone on the phone for customer service and the app is automated responses can't say i want use an uber again bc i travel a lot but i do hope you guys do better with a rider being able to call from a different phone if their phone dies also the price changes aren't fair
