i put in a large sum and purchased some crypto 
by the next day the gemini staff notified me that my bank would not be compatible for what is needed to trade on gemini 
they said i needed an ach transferable account 
i was refunded the full amount that i deposited and all my currencies were set to 0.00
my account i thought was set to go back to a zero balance and all the trades were not awarded 
by now i'm getting annoyed 
i want to close the account but figured i could be at ease knowing all the money i put in was given back and i'm neutral 
so at the beginning of the next month about a week later my bank account gets slapped with another large bill pay putting me upside down for the month
like i said i am disabled and my source of income is small and monthly 
so after paying my rent and being stuck with a fee that i have nothing to show for no value of currency or service provided
i'm accruing numerous fees from my bank for overdraft nsf charges and i'm seeing red
gemini is responsible for this 
i emailed four or five times 
no customer service has contacted me back or resolved any of the matter
i feel taken advantage of 
knowing that this fraudulent or mistake of a charge to my account will not be resolved 
in any timely manner
and honestly i want to be compensated for the hit i took to my bank account after the account was clearly inactive and in the clear
all of a sudden cryptocurrency showed up in my portfolio as if the original minimal spending on smaller crypto's were awarded 
but my bitcoin and bitcoin bch were never awarded 
if i never put money in what gives you the liberty to withdraw from my non ach transferable account (like you said you couldn't)
