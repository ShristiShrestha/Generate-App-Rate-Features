Review: """"""
- the selection of stocks and etfs is quite good -the first thing i noticed is that there's no individual history for buying and selling as well as dividends for individual stocks -second the chart is ok but doesn't really accurately portray pricing movements -i think my rating could've been somewhere between three and four stars except for this one fact when you sell stock and try to withdraw back to your account there is literally a glacial pace- example recently sold several stocks and etfs had to wait seven business days for it to change status from unsettled cash' to available to withdraw' status and only after i emailed the service desk did it magically shift so i could withdraw; once withdraw via ach was selected it just sits there under pending' status without posting-i guess i'm supposed to email again to remind public to take care of processing my withdraw.
