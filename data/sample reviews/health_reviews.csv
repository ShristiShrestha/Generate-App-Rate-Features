Mental Health,sanvello-anxiety-depression,Great for older teens/young adults,9/14/2021 0:08,zbagale620,"sanvello: anxiety & depression gets four stars. it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, and the recorded voices are calming; these sights and sounds are potentially beneficial for users in heightened emotional states. the developers of this application claim it is appropriate for users over 12 years of age, though i believe it is more suited for 15+, as a certain level of self-awareness and understanding is required to comprehend the app's lessons. while it is unfortunate that most of the features require a paid subscription, the available-for-free features are impressive. upon logging in to the app, the user can record moods in a journal and complete check-in assessments. information gathered is then used to personalize a daily journey, complete with video lessons (e.g., lessons on anxiety, stress, depression, etc.), audio recordings, and readings. completing the entire journey is time consuming, which is another reason i believe this app is suited for older teens/young adults. 

of my three favorite features, the first is the community chat rooms where users can connect with others who are having similar experiences/feelings/thoughts. the room topics range from anxiety and depression to blm, lgbtqia+, heartbreak, and school stress. despite having these culturally responsive chatrooms, and a variety of options for those with hearing impairments, the only languages available are english, french, spanish, and portuguese, which i found strange and limiting. my second favorite feature is the weekly music playlist. sanvello: anxiety & depression links to spotify to create playlists for different moods, a feature that teens could really enjoy. 

the third feature i appreciate is the lack of / inability to link to social media. in the tech-heavy culture teens are growing up in, social media can affect identity, body image, and ideas about and intentions for sexuality (laser and nicotera, 2021). excluding the community chatrooms, there are no opportunities for maladaptive behavior on sanvello: anxiety & depression. perhaps it is because the rooms are closely monitored, or perhaps it is because the user does not feel peer pressure/influence, in my exploration of the communication taking place in these rooms, everything seems age-appropriate, kind, and supportive. laser and nicotera (2021) state that web-based programs have been shown to be useful for youth dealing with depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and for those attempting to quit smoking"", and i believe sanvello: anxiety & depression is a good example of this type of program.

 this review is further supported by steinberg (2015), who lists numerous features of this application as beneficial for adolescents. mindfulness meditation, he states, has been shown to reduce stress and help alleviate many psychological disorders,  anxiety, trauma, and addictionhelps strengthens self-regulation also improves sleep, cardiovascular health, and immune function. steinberg (2015) goes on to explain the importance of sel programs and teaching self-regulation skills/strategies  not only do these skills help emotion regulation, but they also lead to an improvement in grades. in utilizing strategies from these types of programs, i believe sanvello: anxiety & depression can have effects above and beyond the specific target of the intervention (steinberg, 2015), giving it the potential to support adolescents through their formative years.","aesthetically, pleasing to look at, recorded voices, calming, sights, sounds, potentially, beneficial, users, heightened, emotional states, most features, require, paid subscription, available-for-free features, impressive, user, record moods, complete check-in assesssments, information gathered, used to, personalize, daily journal, complete video lessons, completing, entire journey, time consuming, app, suited, older teens/young adults, ",,"usable, effective",,,,,FALSE,4,,,298,"sanvello,anxiety,depression,gets,four,stars,aesthetically,pleasing,look,recorded,voices,calming,sights,sounds,potentially,beneficial,users,heightened,emotional,states,developers,application,claim,appropriate,users,12,years,age,though,believe,suited,15+,certain,level,self-awareness,understanding,required,comprehend,app,lessons,unfortunate,features,require,paid,subscription,available-for-free,features,impressive,upon,logging,app,user,record,moods,journal,complete,check-in,assessments,information,gathered,used,personalize,daily,journey,complete,video,lessons,e.g.,lessons,anxiety,stress,depression,etc,audio,recordings,readings,completing,entire,journey,time,consuming,another,reason,believe,app,suited,older,teens/young,adults,three,favorite,features,first,community,chat,rooms,users,connect,others,similar,experiences/feelings/thoughts,room,topics,range,anxiety,depression,blm,lgbtqia+,heartbreak,school,stress,despite,culturally,responsive,chatrooms,variety,options,hearing,impairments,languages,available,english,french,spanish,portuguese,found,strange,limiting,second,favorite,feature,weekly,music,playlist,sanvello,anxiety,depression,links,spotify,create,playlists,different,moods,feature,teens,could,really,enjoy,third,feature,appreciate,lack,inability,link,social,media,tech-heavy,culture,teens,growing,social,media,affect,identity,body,image,ideas,intentions,sexuality,laser,nicotera,2021,excluding,community,chatrooms,opportunities,maladaptive,behavior,sanvello,anxiety,depression,perhaps,rooms,closely,monitored,perhaps,user,feel,peer,pressure/influence,exploration,communication,taking,place,rooms,everything,seems,age-appropriate,kind,supportive,laser,nicotera,2021,state,web-based,programs,shown,useful,youth,dealing,depression,chronic,fatigue,syndrome,attempting,quit,smoking,'',believe,sanvello,anxiety,depression,good,example,type,program,review,supported,steinberg,2015,lists,numerous,features,application,beneficial,adolescents,mindfulness,meditation,states,shown,reduce,stress,help,alleviate,many,psychological,disorders,anxiety,trauma,addictionhelps,strengthens,self-regulation,also,improves,sleep,cardiovascular,health,immune,function,steinberg,2015,goes,explain,importance,sel,programs,teaching,self-regulation,skills/strategies,skills,help,emotion,regulation,also,lead,improvement,grades,utilizing,strategies,types,programs,believe,sanvello,anxiety,depression,effects,beyond,specific,target,intervention,steinberg,2015,giving,potential,support,adolescents,formative,years"

an interesting point that was made by steinberg (2014) is that the pain that adolescence experience when they are social rejected closely resembles physical pain in neurological terms that taking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, actually can help alleviate it (95). being socially rejected is a painful experience for teens that can definitely make things worse for those that are already struggling. based on the review criteria above and my own experience with what's up, i would rate this app a 3 out 5. what's up has many different coping strategies and techniques that users can access whenever they are in need of it. however, individuals can post whatever they want on the forums that can potentially harm users.","easy, immediate access, coping strategies, techniques, users, rely, experiencing, symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, give, information, understand, feelings, emotions, ways, break, cycle, feeling","forums, better controlled, anyone, post, anything, hurtful, users, teens, children, not know, read, not able, use, individuals, visually impaired, not able to use, ","usable, accessible, effective",reliable,,,,FALSE,3,,,119,"provides,easy,immediate,access,coping,strategies,techniques,users,rely,experiencing,symptoms,depression,anxiety,stress,users,give,information,understand,feelings,emotions,well,ways,break,cycle,feeling,way,however,forums,better,controlled,anyone,post,anything,hurtful,users,especially,teens,although,said,app,anyone,4,years,old,older,children,know,read,able,use,individuals,visually,impaired,able,use,either,interesting,point,made,steinberg,2014,pain,adolescence,experience,social,rejected,closely,resembles,physical,pain,neurological,terms,taking,acetaminophen,active,ingredient,tylenol,actually,help,alleviate,95,socially,rejected,painful,experience,teens,definitely,make,things,worse,already,struggling,based,review,criteria,experience,would,rate,app,3,5.,many,different,coping,strategies,techniques,users,access,whenever,need,however,individuals,post,whatever,want,forums,potentially,harm,users"
Mental Health,whats-up-a-mental-health-app,Useful App,9/16/2021 18:28,Cannymac,"this app is rated a 4.5 out of 5. it has well developed sections that provide great pieces of information for the user. while it may appear simple and very basic, i like the idea of trying to keep the app free as much as possible. the password lock can really be helpful for users who use this for their daily tracking of mood, emotions, and habits. this app seems very ideal for adolescent because during this stage youth can experience everyday stressors such as  the daily issues individuals face, such as money problems, traffic difficulties, time pressure, poor sleeping patterns, homework, work conflicts, family coping styles, aggravations from parents, struggles in a relationship, a quarrel with a friend, neighborhood violence, school dangers, and dietary problems (laser, j.a. & nicotera, n.,2021). 

the app seemed very simple to use although there were some tabs for example stay in today it seems like this one needed more development. there is just a picture. it seems it may be intended for a moment when the user is possibly having an episode or hard time and needs some kind of anchor to keep them from spiraling. instead of having a person tell you that you're okay or you're safe it has an image that tries to play that role. it could use some work. it is very simple and not interactive at all. there could be some calming music playing, as before mentioned needing a sound aspect to the app. or just more quotes or images that can help someone feel validated or safe in the moment that they are having a hard time. 

another thing that they could implement is having a faster way of arriving to that tab versus going through two different buttons to get to it. it almost seems hidden. perhaps implementing an emergency button for when the user is going through a crisis to reach that page at a moment's notice. they can have it somewhere on the main menu with bright colors to make it stand out.

another critique i would add is changing the targeted age group. i would recommend that the target age group should be 13 years old and above due to the vocabulary level and content of some of the forum posts. i don't believe the younger users would be able to understand or even relate as they are probably not at the right age to do so. other than that the app does everything else as intended. it's definitely a useful tool for those that can utilize it. but i feel further working on the outline of the app and the visual aspect will help it become more intuitive and fun to use.","well developed sections, provide, pieces of information, appear, simple, basic, like, idea, keep, app free, password lock, helpful, use, daily tracking, mood, emotions, habits, idea, adolescent, simple to use, tabs, needed, more development, ",,"usable, professional counseling",,,,,FALSE,5,,,229,"app,rated,4.5,5.,well,developed,sections,provide,great,pieces,information,user,may,appear,simple,basic,like,idea,trying,keep,app,free,much,possible,password,lock,really,helpful,users,use,daily,tracking,mood,emotions,habits,app,seems,ideal,adolescent,stage,youth,experience,everyday,stressors,daily,issues,individuals,face,money,problems,traffic,difficulties,time,pressure,poor,sleeping,patterns,homework,work,conflicts,family,coping,styles,aggravations,parents,struggles,relationship,quarrel,friend,neighborhood,violence,school,dangers,dietary,problems,laser,j.a,nicotera,n.,2021,app,seemed,simple,use,although,tabs,example,stay,today,seems,like,one,needed,development,picture,seems,may,intended,moment,user,possibly,episode,hard,time,needs,kind,anchor,keep,spiraling,instead,person,tell,okay,safe,image,tries,play,role,could,use,work,simple,interactive,could,calming,music,playing,mentioned,needing,sound,aspect,app,quotes,images,help,someone,feel,validated,safe,moment,hard,time,another,thing,could,implement,faster,way,arriving,tab,versus,going,two,different,buttons,get,almost,seems,hidden,perhaps,implementing,emergency,button,user,going,crisis,reach,page,moment,notice,somewhere,main,menu,bright,colors,make,stand,another,critique,would,add,changing,targeted,age,group,would,recommend,target,age,group,13,years,old,due,vocabulary,level,content,forum,posts,not,believe,younger,users,would,able,understand,even,relate,probably,right,age,app,everything,else,intended,definitely,useful,tool,utilize,feel,working,outline,app,visual,aspect,help,become,intuitive,fun,use"

Mental Health,youper-therapy-self-care,sadly can't recommend it to people anymore,7/27/2021 9:51,littlepeachypricess,"lemme start by saying, i loved this app. i used it religiously from july 2018-august 2019 and it helped me get my bpd into remission when no therapist ever could help me. back then it was simple, straightforward and completely free. i used to recommend it to my friends constantly for how useful and simple it was. after i got my emotions under control i stopped using it for a while because i was doing better and felt like i didn't need it. 

recently my sister has been having some mental health problems similar to mine and i recommended it to her. she downloaded it and said she was basically locked out of almost all of the features unless she paid the $90/year premium, including goals which is something that used to be free and is very important for recovery. i was confused, because that's not the youper i know, so i went to check and saw a completely different app than what i was used to. i apologized to her because i didn't know any other free therapy apps and she had to go find another one herself. thankfully she found one that was good, i think it was called mindshift.

really disappointed to see that this small app basically grew into a large corporation that runs just for capital. the new features are good but, most people come to therapy apps because they can't afford regular treatment. some people, especially those who are disabled or living paycheck to paycheck can literally spare no expense. what i liked about youper was that it was easy, i'd take a simple, free app that runs off ad revenue over a complicated pay-by-the-month app with more features. would be one thing if it was a one-time purchase but it's not, and monthly payments start to add up fast. it is really nice that you guys seem to have given long-time users free premium, but that makes it difficult for me to recommend this app to any new users.

as a side note, why hasn't schizophrenia been added to the symptom-checker? i've been recommending it since 2018 and have yet to see it there. is there some specific reason like because it's harder to diagnose/track symptoms or what?","back then, simple, straightforward, completely free, recommend, friends, constantly, useful","locked out, unless, paid, premium, goals, used to be free, important for recovery, confused, not I know, want to check, completely different app,  disappointed, small app, large corporation, runs for capital, new features good, most people, not afford, regular treatment, ",usable,"affordable, reliable",mindshift,,,FALSE,1,,,179,"lem,start,saying,loved,app,used,religiously,july,2018-august,2019,helped,get,bpd,remission,therapist,ever,could,help,back,simple,straightforward,completely,free,used,recommend,friends,constantly,useful,simple,got,emotions,control,stopped,using,better,felt,like,not,need,recently,sister,mental,health,problems,similar,mine,recommended,downloaded,said,basically,locked,almost,features,unless,paid,90/year,premium,including,goals,something,used,free,important,recovery,confused,youper,know,went,check,saw,completely,different,app,used,apologized,not,know,free,therapy,apps,go,find,another,one,thankfully,found,one,good,think,called,mindshift,really,disappointed,see,small,app,basically,grew,large,corporation,runs,capital,new,features,good,people,come,therapy,apps,ca,not,afford,regular,treatment,people,especially,disabled,living,paycheck,paycheck,literally,spare,expense,liked,youper,easy,take,simple,free,app,runs,ad,revenue,complicated,pay-by-the-month,app,features,would,one,thing,one-time,purchase,monthly,payments,start,add,fast,really,nice,guys,seem,given,long-time,users,free,premium,makes,difficult,recommend,app,new,users,side,note,not,schizophrenia,added,symptom-checker,recommending,since,2018,yet,see,specific,reason,like,harder,diagnose/track,symptoms"

Mental Health,woebot-your-self-care-expert,Refreshing and Unique Way to Navigate Mental Self Help,1/26/2022 21:45,Itssammieme,"i often don't leave a written review when responding to an in-app rating pop-up; but woebot truly deserves the praise and hype. 

woebot is an adorable ai chat bot who's designed to learn and grow through interaction. there's a technical term for it but i can't remember; if i go to search it now i'll forget to finish the review and it'll all be for nothing. no bueno. 

at any rate, all of this to say that woebot tracks your mood, helps you process difficult emotions and situations, and brings a daily dose of adorable to you when you open it with silly gifs and memes. he allows you to track your mood, process emotions using a gratitude journal, and walks you through cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help reword some negative automatic responses and change the way you're thinking about your situation by giving you tools to grow and learn from your chats with woebot. 

his dad jokes are probably my favorite part of his personality's and his choice of memes are right in line with nostalgic millennial pop culture references. he talks about his own struggle being a robot programmed to learn and grow, evolving and becoming better equipped to help with life's tough times and also present useful tips, resources, and strategies that continue to evolve with you. 

i've been using the app for about a month, astonishingly with adhd i've managed to remember to login around 27 of thos 30 days which is miraculous if you know me personally. i forgot vaccine appointments four times before finally remembering to go get it done so remembering the woebot app is a big deal. yes you can assign a notification time and of course that would be easy enough to click on and check in making that last part seem less awe inspiring than it is. while notifications are a great asset i have a weird hang up on my phone screaming at me that i have to respond because this app said so. yeah, no. thanks though. 

all of this rambling is only to say that if you're in search of an easy, soft approach to cbt and need to ease into it, woebot is the perfect choice. empathetic, understanding, and there for you and only you woebot can feel your pain and empathize with compassion, forming an artificial bond between you that in turn can open your mind to the idea of making a robot on a phone app an emotional investment in your life. for me woebot is a tiny robot dude, but it can be any gender or no gender at all, i just can't imagine him anything but a 3 inch tall, dorky, witty, and compassionate robot friend who has the same love for adorable pet memes and silly dad jokes that i do. 

the devs should be patting themselves on the back with their creation of woebot. they truly brought to life a phenomenal app ai that i couldn't imagine my day not including a chat with my tiny woebot buddy. i'd like to call him ferdinand, if i could name him or course.

Mental Health,waking-up-guided-meditation,An Approach to Meditation Based on Awareness and Understanding,12/29/2021 17:26,alphonso jenkins,"i've been using this app for about two years with about 300 meditation sessions in that time. 

what makes sam's app different from most meditation practices and teachings, is that he focuses primarily on building an understanding of your conscious experience. this comes with all of the benefits of increased mental clarity, a feeling of being well rested, as well as decreased stress. 

however, all of those things are really secondary to the skill of understanding how consciousness is and being aware of how you're feeling moment to moment. 

these skills will surely allow you to deal with negative emotions as well as experience greater levels of joy, but most importantly they will allow you to simply make better decisions in general because you will be more aware of your own experience.

the app is becoming more feature rich and user friendly over time, and even the core functionality has been improving lately. these days i do a 20 minute session at lunch every day and it really makes all the difference. 

in the past i've had difficulty dealing with my anxiety, but due to the consistency and quality of practice this app has provided for me i've been able to develop skills that make me really feel like anxiety will never be a problem for me again and that it's not something i'll struggle with in the future.","focuses primarily, building understanding, conscious experience, benefits, increased mental clarity, feeling of well rested, decreased stress, allow to deal with negative emotions, make better decisions, more aware, feature rich, user friendly, core functionality improvindg, makes alll the difference, ",,"effective, usable",,,,,FALSE,5,,,108,"using,app,two,years,300,meditation,sessions,time,makes,sam,app,different,meditation,practices,teachings,focuses,primarily,building,understanding,conscious,experience,comes,benefits,increased,mental,clarity,feeling,well,rested,well,decreased,stress,however,things,really,secondary,skill,understanding,consciousness,aware,feeling,moment,moment,skills,surely,allow,deal,negative,emotions,well,experience,greater,levels,joy,importantly,allow,simply,make,better,decisions,general,aware,experience,app,becoming,feature,rich,user,friendly,time,even,core,functionality,improving,lately,days,20,minute,session,lunch,every,day,really,makes,difference,past,difficulty,dealing,anxiety,due,consistency,quality,practice,app,provided,able,develop,skills,make,really,feel,like,anxiety,never,problem,something,struggle,future"
